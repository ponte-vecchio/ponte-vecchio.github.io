          <description xml:base="https://leothelion.wtf/rx-writing-challenge-2025/">&lt;p&gt;This is a short reflection on my experience of the recent writing challenge I took part in.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the past two weeks, I have participated in the #RxWritingChallenge &lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#Rya22&quot;&gt;1&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;sup&gt;—a daily, 30-minute writing group starting at 9 AM every morning.
Surrounded by fellow doctoral students and staff in the Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences faculty (PPSEd specifically), we wrote daily with Kim (the organising academic)&#x27;s smooth jazz.
This looks like a modest commitment on paper, but you see, I found that it meaningfully reshaped not only my writing practice but also my sense of self, motivation and connection to my broader doctoral journey which nears its end.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the perspective of Bourdieu&#x27;s Theory of Practice, I saw these sessions as a distinct &lt;em&gt;field&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; &lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#Bou77&quot;&gt;2&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;sup&gt;—a structured, socially embedded space in which we operated under particular rules, norms and expectations.
In much of doctoral education (and in academia), writing is perceived as deeply reflective, but isolating.
By contrast, the “field” of our Rx Writing Challenge established a collective norm of short, focused bursts of early-morning effort.
This shifted my typical pattern of working late and waking later.
In Bourdieu&#x27;s terms, I began realigning my &lt;em&gt;habitus&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;—the ingrained dispositions, attitudes, and practices that I bring to my daily life and practice &lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#Bou90&quot;&gt;3&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;sup&gt;—to a fresh &lt;em&gt;doxa&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;: to write first thing in the morning.
To me, whose writing regimen has always been throughout the day and sporadic, I first found this early slot unconventional.
Soon, though, I realised I was starting to internalise the new rules of the field, and eventually came to accept that writing could indeed be triggered simply by opening a laptop and start typing away—rather than waiting for some elusive wave of inspiration, or surge of guilt.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This positive transition would not have been possible without the interpersonal aspect.
&lt;em&gt;Social capital&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; &lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#Bou98&quot;&gt;4&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;sup&gt; was created and strengthened with each session as I recognised familiar faces (and occasionally new ones), all sharing the common goal—to push our writing forward.
Though our words remained our own, the group&#x27;s presence and the light-hearted banter before and after each session built a sense of relatedness—reminding me that PHD need not be so lonely.
With every exchange grew trust, curiosity and solidarity.
This would point to—in Bourdieu&#x27;s terms—the accumulation of social capital that fosters mutual support and normalises the “game” of writing within this Rx Writing micro-community.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My involvement also revealed how &lt;em&gt;illusio&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; operates in a practical sense.
In Bourdieu&#x27;s Theory of Practice, illusio refers to the belief that a particular endeavour is worth pursuing—that its ‘rules’ matter &lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#Bou77&quot;&gt;2&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;sup&gt;&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#Bou90&quot;&gt;3&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;sup&gt;.
Before these challenges, my writing habits were erratic, often shaped by the demands of teaching or the fatigue of late-night brainstorming.
Embracing the (almost) daily challenge meant that I “bought into” its logic—that mere 30-minute spring could somehow, and magically so, heighten my productivity and reduce writing anxiety.
Rather than fighting my own rhythms, I just wrote.
Remarkably so—and much to my own surprise—the intense focus yielded a sense of competence and genuine progress on my thesis each session.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This process also highlights elements of &lt;em&gt;cultural capital&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; &lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#Bou98&quot;&gt;4&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;sup&gt;.
Though we typically think of cultural capital through tacit knowledge of soe cultural ‘know-how’, the practice of turning up on time, coffee in hand, saying hello to everyone, and slipping into “heads-down” mode formed part of a culture of communal writing.
To me, it was subtle, but a powerful code.
After a week of this, I realised that I could, in Bourdieu&#x27;s words, reshape my habitus &lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#Bou90&quot;&gt;3&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;sup&gt; even further—fully developing into a physical and mental routine that made “just writing” feel natural.
This subsequently enhanced my sense of academic identity as I felt more like a regular, active participant in a scholarly activity that was communal—not solitary.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sadly, the official two-week challenge has ended, and I sense a strong desire for these session to continue.
Not only did I acquire a practice that directly benefitted me, but the sense of empowerment was also something I didn&#x27;t know I needed until I experienced it.
Belonging to a field is never just a matter of ticking boxes—it&#x27;s about gaining recognition of one&#x27;s position, adopting the field&#x27;s doxa and illusio, and layering new forms of capital onto one&#x27;s existing habitus &lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#Bou77&quot;&gt;2&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;sup&gt;&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-reference&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#Bou90&quot;&gt;3&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;sup&gt;.
The blend (pun intended) of early-morning coffee, &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=3jWRrafhO7M&quot;&gt;smooth jazz&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=ZWUlLHv7-64&quot;&gt;Brian Eno&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, and shared accountability brought unexpected clarity and productivity in times of need—my thesis-writing phase.
This was all in the meanwhile reinforcing the idea that being in the thesis-writing phase doesn&#x27;t have to mean I must write alone or bear it on my own.
I hope to carry these new changes forward, as I hope the writing challenges continue in the months to come.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

          <title>Korea’s Socio-Political Crisis</title>
          <pubDate>Mon, 17 Mar 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

          <description xml:base="https://leothelion.wtf/korea-fascism/">&lt;p&gt;I write in grievance and immense sadness, for it is a country I once called home.
It has been three months since Yoon’s Martial Law Crisis &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bbc.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;articles&#x2F;c0lgw1pw5zpo&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.
As his impeachment trial continues, Korea stands divided between those who support the president, waving the US and Israeli flags &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.koreaherald.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;10382435&quot;&gt;[2]&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, and those who are apparently Chinese state agents &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.straitstimes.com&#x2F;asia&#x2F;east-asia&#x2F;pro-yoon-supporters-fuel-wild-speculation-of-chinese-influence-in-political-crisis&quot;&gt;[3]&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.
In this commentary, I argue that this is a symptom not a cause, of the downfall of Korea should it continue down the path it had trodden for the last 40 years.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;military-rule-to-chaebol-dominance&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#military-rule-to-chaebol-dominance&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: military-rule-to-chaebol-dominance&quot;&gt;Military rule to Chaebol dominance&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;South Korea’s modern history has been shaped by a transition from one form of authoritarianism to a another.
After the Korean War, the country endured decades of military dictatorship under leaders like Park Chung-hee and Chun Doo-hwan, who ruled through martial law and suppression of dissent &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;leothelion.wtf&#x2F;korea-fascism&#x2F;(https:&#x2F;&#x2F;carnegieendowment.org&#x2F;emissary&#x2F;2024&#x2F;12&#x2F;martial-law-south-korea-overturned-what-happened?lang=en)&quot;&gt;[4]&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;​.
This &lt;em&gt;“proto-fascist” period&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; entrenched authoritarian governance and brutally stifled democratic freedoms.
Even when mass protests finally forced a democratic opening in 1987​, political and economic power did not disperse widely.
Instead, it shifted into the hands of corporate oligarchs, the family-run conglomerates known as chaebol &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Chaebol&quot;&gt;[5]&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.
Essentially, &lt;em&gt;South Korea moved from a military dictatorship to a “chaebol-driven” capital dictatorship&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, where economic elites wield outsized influence over society.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This symbiotic ties between the state and chaebols were forged during the proto-Fascist era and still persist today &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cfr.org&#x2F;backgrounder&#x2F;south-koreas-chaebol-challenge&quot;&gt;[6]&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.
Starting from Park Chung-Hee’s regime which deliberately partnered with select family-owned firms to fuel rapid industrialisation through cheap credit and policy favours &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;catalog.loc.gov&#x2F;vwebv&#x2F;search?searchCode=LCCN&amp;amp;searchArg=91039109&amp;amp;searchType=1&amp;amp;permalink=y&quot;&gt;[7]&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.
From a macroeconomic perspective, this strategy led to the famed “Miracle on the Han”—transforming a war-torn nation into a global economic powerhouse—but at the cost of &lt;em&gt;concentrating wealth and power in the hands of a few&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;.
Over time, the chaebols grew into behemoths that dominate the economy.
By 2023, the four largest chaebol groups – Samsung, SK, Hyundai and LG – had combined revenues equal to nearly 41% of the country’s GDP—while the top 30 accounted for a staggering 77% &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.koreatimes.co.kr&#x2F;www&#x2F;biz&#x2F;2025&#x2F;01&#x2F;602_383889.html&quot;&gt;[8]&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.
According to Scott A. Snyder &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cfr.org&#x2F;book&#x2F;south-korea-crossroads&quot;&gt;[9]&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, these conglomerates “contributed more to Korean social inequality than to society”.
In effect, Korea’s post-authoritarian order allowed a &lt;em&gt;new elite class&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;—the chaebol owners and their allies—to continue the concentration of power, reproducing authoritarian dynamics under the disguise of democracy.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;embedded-authoritarianism&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#embedded-authoritarianism&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: embedded-authoritarianism&quot;&gt;Embedded authoritarianism&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The legacy of authoritarianism is not just political but deeply ingrained in Korean society.
Social relations often mirror the strict stratification of the past—perhaps a legacy of the rigid class system of the Joseon dynasty (the yangban aristocrats vs. commoners)—that Koreans wryly reference in the popular term “Hell Joseon” &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.abc.net.au&#x2F;news&#x2F;2020-01-30&#x2F;south-korea-hell-joseon-sampo-generation&#x2F;11844506&quot;&gt;[10]&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.
This satirical phrase based on the harsh truth compares today’s Korea to a feudal hellscape of relentless pressure and competition, while being completely stuck in a stratified pecking order (See e.g., &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.globalasia.org&#x2F;v11no2&#x2F;cover&#x2F;rising-inequalities-in-south-korea-and-the-search-for-a-new-business-ecosystem_choong-yong-ahn&quot;&gt;[11]&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jacobin.com&#x2F;2021&#x2F;10&#x2F;squid-game-capitalism-south-korea-parasite-inequality-netflix&quot;&gt;[12]&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;).
Hell Joseon is a reflection of a society where success is a zero-sum dominated by the elites.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Competition is a defining ethos in every sphere of life&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;.
From as early as two, Koreans are hammered with the compulsion to compete for top ranks (see e.g., &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=DysyxTqFlnY&quot;&gt;[13]&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;) as their entire life trajectory entails just that—in school, at university, in the job market, and even in marriage &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;holistic.news&#x2F;en&#x2F;south-korea-sorrow-in-the-land-of-chaebols&#x2F;&quot;&gt;[14]&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.
Korean culture is marked by a &lt;em&gt;cult of competitiveness that permeates homes, schools and workplaces&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;.
The dominant narrative taught from birth is that corporate and career success matter than personal well-being, i.e. &lt;em&gt;there is a right way to live one’s life&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;—one misstep then you are simply not worthy, a failure.
This fostered an environment where employees are forced to sacrifice everything for their companies, resulting in the most grueling work hours in the world &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.kdi.re.kr&#x2F;eng&#x2F;research&#x2F;focusView?pub_no=18199&quot;&gt;[15]&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.
Perhaps a remnant of the Korean Confucianism &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;plato.stanford.edu&#x2F;entries&#x2F;korean-confucianism&#x2F;&quot;&gt;[16]&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; that all things are in a natural order of hierarchy, these internalised hierarchy ensures that authoritarian dynamics continue at the micro level: bosses command fealty, seniors bully juniors &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Gapjil&quot;&gt;[17]&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, and social status dictates one’s worth.
Such toxic cultures erode mental health, and push the vulnerable minority toward suicide.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Class divisions have hardened under these conditions as well.
Economic inequality has been on the rise &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wid.world&#x2F;news-article&#x2F;income-inequality-in-south-korea-1933-2022&#x2F;&quot;&gt;[18]&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, with the wealth of chaebol families contrasting sharply against the struggles of ordinary workers and small-business owners &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;keia.org&#x2F;the-peninsula&#x2F;is-korea-ready-to-move-past-its-love-hate-relationship-with-chaebols&#x2F;&quot;&gt;[19]&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.
Chaebols’ capital dominance squeeze out smaller firms that limit entrepreneurship and social mobility.
Good jobs are disproportionately provided by the chaebol conglomerates or in the public sector, which creates a winner-takes-all races to be on one of these elite tracks.
These are, however, not of merit but of educational pedigree and family connections (often called “spec”) that largely determine one’s class destination—which simply perpetuates the cycle of inequality.
This elite reproduction ensures the children of the affluent secure the best education, best connections, then top jobs, perpetuating a cycle of privilege while others are ensured to remain locked out.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yoon is such a product of this system, having attended the prestigious Choongam High School, SNU to study Law and working as a prosecutor before entering politics.
To illustrate the gravity of the situation, &lt;em&gt;there was a whole clique of people who attended Choongam High School that also led the martial law crisis&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;: Sang-Min Lee, head of &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mois.go.kr&#x2F;eng&#x2F;a01&#x2F;engMain.do&quot;&gt;the Interior and Safety&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;; Yong-Hyun Kim, head of &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mnd.go.kr&#x2F;&quot;&gt;National Defence&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; &amp;amp; Chief of the Presidential Security Service; Se-Yeong Hwang, head of &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.smpa.go.kr&#x2F;home&#x2F;homeIndex.do?menuCode=101ppsc&quot;&gt;101st PPSC&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;; In-Hyeong Yeo, Chief Commander at the Defense Counter-intelligence Command; Jong-Seon Park, head of the Defence Security Agency, and list goes on.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As millions of ordinary Korean struggle to make ends meet, a handful of elites maintain an iron grip on the economy and power structure, enjoying &lt;em&gt;de facto&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; immunity and influence.
The result is a society that &lt;em&gt;formally&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; shed dictatorship, yet everyday life is still governed by authoritarian patterns—which I call a passage from proto-fascist society to a kind of “post-fascism” where hierarchical, anti-democratic values persist under the guise of democracy, without a formal dictatorship.
We may turn to institutions, the last refuge of democracy, where the imbalance of power and wealth is openly challenged and kept in check. Unless?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;institutions-perpetuate-inequality-over-democracy-and-liberalism&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#institutions-perpetuate-inequality-over-democracy-and-liberalism&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: institutions-perpetuate-inequality-over-democracy-and-liberalism&quot;&gt;Institutions perpetuate inequality over democracy and liberalism&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than alleviating these inequalities, many of Korea’s institutions entrench them—prioritising social control and elite interests over democratic empowerment.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the micro level, the education system in Korea can be described as “stressful, authoritarian, and brutally competitive” &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wenr.wes.org&#x2F;2018&#x2F;10&#x2F;education-in-south-korea&quot;&gt;[20]&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; that instills obedience to power and authority, perpetual competition and a lack of critical thinking skills.
I believe that no one under this regime of education would become a critically-thinking democracy-abiding citizen, but a failure of a Fascist tainted in childhood trauma of defeatism and self-loathe.
This unfortunately has been 40 years in the making.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the institutional level, universities and schools are often beholden to corporate interests and political power.
When a $200 million dollar donation from Samsung chairman was made in 2003 in exchange for an honorary doctorate degree &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.hankookilbo.com&#x2F;News&#x2F;Read&#x2F;200001280084136336&quot;&gt;[21]&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, it was met with an outcry from the students who feared that the donation would be used to buy influence and power.
The professors at Korea University quickly dismissed these concerns and quit their tenure positions in protest because they could not protect the lord Samsung &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;h21.hani.co.kr&#x2F;arti&#x2F;special&#x2F;special_general&#x2F;13783.html&quot;&gt;[22]&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.
This is not an isolated incident, but a symptom of a broader trend where universities are increasingly reliant on chaebol donations and government funding, which can compromise academic freedom and critical inquiry.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the societal level, there’s ample reflection of authoritarian socialisation.
The workplace culture, as I noted earlier, is intensely hierarchical; there is no such thing as corporate democracy—labour unions are seen as communist and North Korea sympathisers, and laws have curtailed organisation and strikes &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jacobin.com&#x2F;2024&#x2F;10&#x2F;south-korea-workers-rights-law&quot;&gt;[23]&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.
The media landscape, while considered “free”, is dominated by conservative interests, leading to news coverage that downplays structural inequality and favours status quo over calls for reform.
Further, religious institutions and mandated military service install conformist values—young men spend two years in a rigid military hierarchy, an experience that is often ameliorated as a rite of passage to manhood, but is in fact an experience that reinforces authoritarian values and gendered norms (since women are exempt, it breeds resentments and chauvinism).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Critically, institutions working under the banner of democracy have not fully challenged the entrenched hierarchies and authoritarian values which has never stopped plaguing Korea.
Due democratic processes exist, but they may also be seen as legitimising the status quo rather than challenging it.
Electoral politics are seen as free and boisterous, yet the two major parties are largely indistinguishable in their values and policies—both are pro-chaebol, conservative and against liberalism.
In this sense, the political establishment has not functioned as a check on the elite, but as a vehicle for their interests.
Institutions that should promote democratic, liberal values have instead perpetuated class divisions and authoritarian culture.
This kind of institutional inertia is what I call a hallmark of “post-fascism” where formal democratic rules exist, but the underlying power dynamics and social relations remain authoritarian where, fascists are not “converted from democracy” but “groomed from birth”.
Surely then, all we need is education?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;education-internalised-fascism&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#education-internalised-fascism&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: education-internalised-fascism&quot;&gt;Education: internalised fascism&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, one of the &lt;em&gt;most potent mechanisms sustained this undemocratic social order is the education system itself&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;.
I argue that Korean education inculcates a kind of &lt;em&gt;internalised fascism&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; in the minds of its students.
Firstly, it’s geared towards intense competition, conformity and deference to authority.
Children spend most of their waking hours within a rigid schooling of a hakwon system that leaves little room for free thought, personal growth, or even to just play.
The rules of engagement are strict with harsh discipline.
The curriculum emphasises rote memorisation and standardised test taking over critical thinking and creativity.
Corporal punishment was also commonplace until recently, which instilled immense fear and obedience in students, further reinforcing the authoritarian culture that “authority must be obeyed without question“.
Education in Korea is, above all else, a system of hierarchy that constantly ranks and sorts students, reinforcing the idea that some are inherently superior to others.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this kind of education system, there cannot be room for questioning authority or challenging the status quo.
In fact, it does the opposite.
Teachers, who are also under pressure themselves to produce high-scoring students, often emphasise discipline over discussion.
Education in topics like sex, human rights, civil liberties, or democratic citizenship is often side-lined in favour of moral instruction that teaches conformity to social norms.
Even if they are taught, they are often just another subject to memorise and regurgitate, rather than to critically engage with.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, schools implicitly and explicitly teach students (for 12 years!) to accept the system as it is: &lt;strong&gt;respect the rules of the game&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; (authority), and the &lt;strong&gt;rules are to compete with each other&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; (which divides people into winners and losers), and that in this game, &lt;strong&gt;winner takes all&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This nurtures a populace that, even in adulthood, may accept the status quo without question, and may be less inclined to challenge hierarchical structures—a kind of internalised authoritarianism.
These thoughts are carried forward into the workplace, military service, communities and families, perpetuating the cycle.
The reverence for prestigious universities also feeds elite reproduction: since entry to top schools is seen as the ticket to the ruling class, those with means give their children every advantage to win this race.
And indeed, graduates of the top three universities (often children of the elite) dominate high-ranking positions in government and business​ reinforcing class stratification.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The human cost of South Korea’s elite-dominated, pressure-cooker society is evident in several intertwined social crises.
Years of systemic failures to build an inclusive, democratic society have led to record-high suicide rates, persistent gender inequality, and now a demographic collapse.
These problems in my opinion are not isolated; they are symptoms of a society stretched to its limits by inequality and micro-authoritarian pressures.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;suicide&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#suicide&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: suicide&quot;&gt;Suicide&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the developed world, South Korea has one of the highest suicide rates.
Interestingly, it is most pronounced amongst the elderly and the children.
Nearly half of senior citizens live in poverty, many having been left behind by the breakneck economic growth.
Elder Koreans often take their own lives due to financial desperation or feeling like a burden, an indictment of a failed social net.
Youth suicide is also distressingly common, now leading cause of death for young Koreans in their teens, 20s and 30s.
These are attributed by continuous exposure to stress, mandatory military service for men, intense competition in early years that lead to even tougher job market that leave many hopeless.
Korea’s social fabric is strained when many see death as the only relief from the living hell that is unrelenting competition and social isolation.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;gender-inequality&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#gender-inequality&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: gender-inequality&quot;&gt;Gender inequality&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another symptom of a post-Fascist society is how akin it is to a patriarchal society.
Women in Korea have made strides in education and employment but there is persistent male dominance in almost all professional and social arenas.
South Korea consistently ranks near the bottom of the OECD countries in gender equality metrics.
It also has the largest gender pay gap in the developed world, where women earn roughly 63% of what men earn on average &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;thediplomat.com&#x2F;2023&#x2F;10&#x2F;how-do-south-koreans-view-gender-discrimination&#x2F;&quot;&gt;[24]&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.
In the Global Gender Gap Index, Korea ranks 105th out of 146—indicating a significant disparity in economic and political empowerment for women.
These reflect both workplace discrimination and deeply-ingrained cultural norms that men are expected to be breadwinners and women to be caretakers.
What of working women? They also face “glass ceiling” in promotions and are pressured to quit jobs after marriage or childbirth.
Women not conforming to these norms are often ridiculed (e.g. “no-cheo-nyeo” meaning “old virgin”) and mocked.
There’s also a remarkable uptick in gender war.
For example, women’s calls for equality and #MeToo revevlations of harassment have been met with defensive and misogynistic reactions from young Korean men.
These are not isolated left-right men-women issues—it’s a fundamental democratic deficit, denying half the population full participation in society while normalising it as a “cultural” issue.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;demographic-collapse&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#demographic-collapse&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: demographic-collapse&quot;&gt;Demographic collapse&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Relatedly, South Korea’s plummeted birth rate to being the lowest i the world.
In 2023, the country hit 0.78 children per woman, far below the replacement rate of 2.1.
Rooted in a variety of factors I have discussed, the demographic crisis is a result of a society that is too competitive, too unequal, and too authoritarian.
Young couples are opting out of children because of the high costs and pressures.
Housing prices are also exorbitant, education costs for children are frightening (e.g. near-compulsory private education), and jobs that accommodate young families are near-impossible.
This is a population time bomb with far-reaching consequences: a rapidly-aging population, shrinking workforce, shrinking tax base, and greater welfare burden.
It is a signal of a society that people feel hesistent to bring new life into, because of its systemic strains and pessimism about the future.
It is, to my understanding, the starkest indictment of Korea’s unsustainability.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Combined, the on-going authoritarian legacies ingrained in Korean society have led to a society that is deeply unequal, deeply unhappy, and deeply unsustainable—evident in the nation’s suicide epidemic, extreme gender inequalities, and demographic collapse.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-does-this-mean&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#what-does-this-mean&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: what-does-this-mean&quot;&gt;What does this mean?&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, these social crises are big fat giant red flags that signal how Korea’s model is failing its people in many fundamental ways.
A society where so many are driven to despair, where minority groups are not treated as equals, where the next generation is not being born, is a society in deep, deep, DEEP shit.
I repeat: Korea has never moved on from its authoritarian roots.
The link to the proto- and post-fascist elements is clear: authoritarian, elitist systems inevitably devalue individual well-being—for people become cogs in a machine of nationalism, with predictable human fallout.
Yoon’s martial law crisis, where officials who shared elite educational backgrounds attempted to undermine democracy, reflects precisely the kind of authoritarian elitism fostered by the history of past dictatorships, internalised fascism and chaebol culture.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Korea’s much-lauded miracle is also a dark underside that has been 40 years in the making.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

          <description xml:base="https://leothelion.wtf/on-spelling-2/">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;..&#x2F;on-spelling-1&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Previously&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, I examined the inherent irregularities and complexities of English spelling, comparing it to other writing systems and languages. I also briefly critiqued the illogical nature of English orthography and how changes over time and external influences have shaped it. In this post, I will delve deeper into the history of English spelling and the reasons behind its inconsistencies.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;the-problems-are-chronic&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#the-problems-are-chronic&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: the-problems-are-chronic&quot;&gt;The Problems are Chronic&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;English spelling has caused problems for about as long as there have been words to spell. When the Anglo-Saxons became literate in the 6th century, they borrowed their alphabet from the Romans. However, they realised Roman inventory of sounds did not match three of their sounds. They took three characters from the old runic alphabet to rectify this: &lt;em&gt;w&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;þ&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;ð&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;. The first is quite literally a double &lt;em&gt;u&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; represented by the sound ‘w’ as it is pronounced today. The next two represented the two forms of ‘th’: þ (called thorn) and ð (called eth). But everything changed when the fire nation attacked.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;for-once-it-wasn-t-the-americans&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#for-once-it-wasn-t-the-americans&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: for-once-it-wasn-t-the-americans&quot;&gt;For once it wasn’t the Americans&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Norman scribes came to England and began grappling with what was to them a wholly foreign tongue.
The struggle was real, clearly evident in a myriad of spellings from &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;opendomesday.org&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Domesday Book&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.
Let’s take one small parish in Yorkshire.
Hanlith was written as Hagenlith, Malham as Malgham, and Calton as Colton—all of which were probably never used locally.
But are these simply cherry-picked examples of carelessness and unfamiliarity?
I argue not, since others clearly reflect preferences for Norman orthography.
You see, Normans did not hold back when it comes to introducing changes to make English seem more comfortable (to them at least), like replacing the Old English &lt;em&gt;cw&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; with &lt;em&gt;qu&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;.
If William the Conquerer had been turned back at &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Battle_of_Hastings&quot;&gt;Hastings&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, we would be spelling &lt;em&gt;queen&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; as &lt;em&gt;cwene&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;.
This wasn’t the only change.
The letters &lt;em&gt;z&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;g&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; were introduced, and the Old English &lt;em&gt;þ&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;ð&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; were phased out.
The Normans also made sounds like &lt;em&gt;ch&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;sh&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; more regular, which in Anglo-Saxon could be written in a variety of ways.
They also substituted &lt;em&gt;o&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; for &lt;em&gt;u&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, in words like &lt;em&gt;one&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;come&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, introduced &lt;em&gt;ou&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; for words like &lt;em&gt;house&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;mouse&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;.
The problem was, this only made sense for Norman scribes but not necessarily for native speakers of English.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;it-was-the-english&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#it-was-the-english&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: it-was-the-english&quot;&gt;It was the English&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like everywhere else, lack of central authority for the English language for nearly three centuries meant dialects came about and multiplied.
This meant that when the last of the Anglo-Normans were driven out and English words swooped back in to literary practice, people adopted the spellings one region and the pronunciation of another.
This is why we use the western England’s spelling for &lt;em&gt;busy&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;bury&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; but use the London pronunciation ‘bizzy’ and Kentish pronunciation ‘berry’.
Similarly, if you’ve ever questioned why &lt;em&gt;one&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; would be pronounced ‘won’ and &lt;em&gt;once&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; could be pronounced ‘wons’, the answer lies in the fact that Southern pronunciations were merged to East Midland spellings.
There was a time they were pronounced more like they were spelled, i.e. ‘oon’ and ‘oons’.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even without the Norman intervention, there’s every reason to believe that English spelling would have been chaotic. This is largely because, for the longest time, the English did not seem to care about the matters of spelling (in)consistency. Of course there were exceptions, like &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Orrm&quot;&gt;Orrm&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;—a 12th century monk—who called for a more logical phonetic system for spelling. Obviously everyone ignored him. An example of such lack of concern for niceties of spelling can be found in the description of &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;James_VI_and_I&quot;&gt;James I&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; where you see &lt;em&gt;two&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; variants of clothes in one sentence:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;br&gt;He was one of a middle stature, more corpulent though in his &lt;strong&gt;clothes&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; than in his body,&lt;br&gt;
yet fat enough, his &lt;strong&gt;cloathes&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; being ever maid large and easie …&lt;&#x2F;i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even more remarkable is &lt;em&gt;A Table Alphabeticall of Hard Usual English Words&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; (1604) by Robert Cawdrey—coined the first ever English dictionary—whose title page spelled &lt;em&gt;words&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; in two ways:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;br&gt;A Table Alphabeticall of Hard Usual English &lt;strong&gt;Words&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;conteyning and teaching the true writing, and vnderstanding of hard vsuall English &lt;strong&gt;wordes&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;, borrowed from the Hebrew, Greeke, Latine, or French, &amp;amp;c. With the interpretation thereof by plaine English &lt;strong&gt;words&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;, gathered for the benefit &amp;amp; helpe of ladies, gentlewomen, or any other vnskilfull persons.&lt;br&gt;Whereby they may the more easilie and better vnderstand many hard English &lt;strong&gt;wordes&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;, vvhich they shall heare or read in scriptures, sermons, or elswhere, and also be made able to vse the same aptly themselues.&lt;br&gt;&lt;&#x2F;i&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout this period, you can find names and words spelled in just about every imaginable way possible. &lt;em&gt;Where&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, for example, has been recorded as:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;i&gt;
&lt;p&gt;wher&lt;br&gt;
whair&lt;br&gt;
wair&lt;br&gt;
wheare&lt;br&gt;
were&lt;br&gt;
whear&lt;br&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;&#x2F;i&gt;&lt;&#x2F;center&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People were even more casual about their own names, like Shakespeare.
Did you know that at least 80 different spellings of Shakespeare’s name have been found?
Among them are &lt;em&gt;Shagspeare&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Shakspere&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, and even &lt;em&gt;Shakestaffe&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; 💀.
Shakespeare himself did not spell the name the same way twice in any of his six known signatures and even spelled it two ways in one document—&lt;em&gt;his own will&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;—which he signed &lt;em&gt;Shakspere&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; in one place and &lt;em&gt;Shakspeare&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; in another.
Curiously, the one spelling he never used was &lt;em&gt;Shakespeare&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;.
One might think that a person’s signature, whether he an Elizabethan playwright or a 21st century influencer, is about the least reliable way of determining how he spells his name.
Many people scrawl in their signatures, myself included, and Shakespeare was certainly one of history’s scrawlers.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-matter-of-size-and-speed&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#a-matter-of-size-and-speed&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: a-matter-of-size-and-speed&quot;&gt;A Matter of Size and Speed&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An odd fact of spelling in this era is that although writing must have been laborious, there was no effort to compress or simplify spellings.
In fact, the complete opposite was the case.
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Oliver_Cromwell&quot;&gt;Cromwell&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; habitually spelled &lt;em&gt;itt&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; for &lt;em&gt;it&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;nott&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; for &lt;em&gt;not&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;bee&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; for &lt;em&gt;be&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;atte&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; for &lt;em&gt;at&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;.
These cumbersome spellings appear in manuscripts right up until the modern period.
Surely, people would’ve been more compelled to more compact spellings by writer’s cramp if not by urgency.
Before 15th century, it was all possible to tell exactly where in Britain a letter or manuscript was written just by examining the spellings.
From 1500 onwards, all was chaos.
Amidst all this, one prolific invention came to light: the &lt;strong&gt;printing press&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;.
Printing press brought a desperately-needed uniformity to English spelling.
At the same time, it guaranteed t hat we would inherit one of the most absurdly inconsistent spelling systems in the world.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-dutch-press&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#the-dutch-press&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: the-dutch-press&quot;&gt;The Dutch press&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every person knows that the printing press was invented by &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Johannes_Gutenberg&quot;&gt;Johannes Gutenberg&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; in 1440.
Though, history may have given Gutenberg more credit than he deserved.
There’s basis to believe that the first movable type was actually invented by &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Laurens_Janszoon_Coster&quot;&gt;Laurens Janszoon Coster&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; of Haarlem in the Netherlands.
It is said that Gutenberg—whom knew little of printing press—learned of the process only when one of Coster’s apprentices ran off to Mainz with some of Coster’s blocks and the became mates.
Regardless, what is certain is that the process took off with astonishing speed.
Between 1455 and 1500, more than 35,000 books were published in Europe alone.
This attracted the attention of an Englishman living in Brugge.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;William Caxton (1422–1491) was a rich English businessman based in Brugge—then one of the &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Bruges#Golden_age_(12th_to_15th_centuries)&quot;&gt;largest trading cities of Europe&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.
Caxton smelled big money in the printing press business so he set up his own publishing house in Brugge, starting with a translation of &lt;em&gt;Recuyell of the Historyes of Troye&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; in 1475.
Ironically, this was the oldest publication in English and it was in Flanders not England.
Upon retuning to England, he set himself up in the precincts of Westminster Abbey in London and began to issue a tsunami of books of all types—history, philosophy, works of Chaucer and Malory and more.
Caxton’s quick and easy success saw many others in England also set up presses in competition.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By 1640, according to Baugh and Cable, there were 20,000 titles (not books) available in Britain.
With the rise of printing, there was suddenly a need towards regularised spelling.
London spellings became increasingly fixed, though differences in regional vocabularies remained for some time.
Alas, just as every Brit must use London English when reading, the English of the capital city became &lt;em&gt;de facto&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; standard for printed materials in the 17th century.
Although irregularities persisted for some time, the standardisation was effectively fully settled by 1650.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;they-blame-poor-timing&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#they-blame-poor-timing&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: they-blame-poor-timing&quot;&gt;They blame poor timing&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, this standardisation was happening just at the time when English was undergoing one of those &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Great_Vowel_Shift&quot;&gt;seizures&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; that disturb any language.
This meant that in today’s English, we have a body of spellings that &lt;em&gt;very faithfully&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; reflect the pronunciations of people who lived some 400 years ago.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in Chaucer’s day, the &lt;em&gt;k&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; in &lt;em&gt;knight&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; was pronounced, as with &lt;em&gt;knee&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;know&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;.
&lt;em&gt;Knight&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;  would’ve sounded more like &lt;em&gt;ka-nee-ga-ta&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, with every consonant pronounced.
The &lt;em&gt;g&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; in &lt;em&gt;gnaw&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;gnat&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; was also pronounced, as with &lt;em&gt;l&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; in &lt;em&gt;alm&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;folk&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;.
In short, &lt;strong&gt;the silent letters of most words that just shadows of their former pronunciation.&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;
Perhaps, if Caxton had brought the printing press a generation later, English would’ve had fewer illogical spellings like &lt;em&gt;aisle&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;eight&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;enough&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; and so on.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;But it gets worse (to be continued).&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

          <description xml:base="https://leothelion.wtf/honja-240905/">&lt;p&gt;한달간의 차단 이후 다시 연락은 이어진다.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;아빠는 9월 1일 보낸 해피 파더스 데이. 알고보니 나를 무시했다고 생각한 예상은 빗나가고 사실은 며칠 늦게 답한 것 뿐이었다. 나는 아무 말 안했는데 스샷을 찍어서 보내셨더라. 물론 여전히 &quot;대화&quot;라는 것은 안 하고 있고.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;hr &#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;엄마는 나한테 아침부터 전화를 하셨다. 물론 받지 않았지. 아버지를 설득하라는 내용이었거든.
아버지는 암 치료를 위해 일본에 갔다온다하신 모양인데 엄마는 이를 &quot;상황이 어떻게 돌아가는지 모르겠다&quot;고 하셨다. 방금 상황이 어떻게 돌아가는지 말해놓고서?
이야기가 기승전결이 없이 그때 그때 통고식으로 하니 당혹과 당황으러움 두려움이 너무 버겁다 하신다. 답정너가 어떻게 소통을 바래?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;아버지도 좀 그래. 언제 가냐 물었는데 &quot;곧 갈거야 ㅎㅎ&quot; 이 지랄을 하네? 그러면서 엄마를 설득하라고? 둘 다 너무 이기적이잖아.
나는 엄마와 아버지의 소통하는 기계가 아니야. 나 당신들 아들이라고.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;나를 이용해서 소통이 되는거면 그건 소통이 아니지. 부부상담사를 봐야하는 일이야. 나는 일방적으로 누구의 감정 쓰레기통이 되기도 싫고 누구의 비둘기가 되기도 싫어. 나는 지금 나 사는거도 벅찬데 (물론 더 행복하니까 이 쪽이 ㅎㅎ) 누구의 감정을 더 소화해낼 여유가 없어.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;그리고 며칠 후 [엄마는] 내 대문사진 때문에 또 뭐라 하신다. 휴머를 휴머로 알아듣지 못하는거는 저번에 보낸 책상에 앉은 개 사진도 그러셨듯이 (&quot;네 개니?&quot;)&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;성실히 살아라&quot;가 또 나오네? 이번에는 내가 좀 발칵했다. 정직하지 않은 사람한테 정직하자라고 말하듯이 불성실한 사람한테 성실하게 살아라라고 하는거 아니냐; 내가 불성실하게 산다고 생각하시냐; 이런 식으로 되물으니 &quot;지금 매우 잘 하고 있습니다&quot;라고 꼬리를 내리셨다. 근데 나는 켕기는게 많거든. 내가 유교보이라서 들은 말들도 많고 말이야. 난 몰아세웠지.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;누구는 공무원 몇 급에 누구는 병원 뭐에 하는데 나는 내세울 거 없지 않느냐
자식보람 있다 하기에는 많이 부족한 아들이지 않느냐&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;더 혹독하게 채찍질하며 산다고 했다.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;내가 속으로는 모질지 못한 사람이라 사실 이렇게 말해도 되나 싶다. 근데 이렇게 먼저 나한테 말한 사람이 누군데. 빙산의 일각이야. 잘못 찌르면 봇물터지듯이 나와버릴텐데? 난 반격할 준비가 되어있어. 마냥 묵묵하게 닥치고 있을 수는 없다.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

          <description xml:base="https://leothelion.wtf/honja-240810/">&lt;p&gt;8월1일 아버지에게 한 커밍아웃. 그리고 예상했던 아주 지극히 예상해 왔던 반응. 어차피 아버지는 나랑 매일 소통하는 관계도 아니잖아. 지금까지 그래왔듯이 다음번 통화할 때는 몇 개월 후 임을 암시한 말에 대해 내가 너무 과민하게 생각하는걸까? 그런데 그러기에는 아버지가 한 다른 말들이 너무 마음에 걸려.
아마 내가 연쇄강간범라고 했어도 이보다는 반응이 더 좋았을거야. 나는 뭐 잘못한것도 없는데 &quot;사회적 통념&quot;이라는 전혀 논리적이지 않은 이유 하나만으로 아버지는 나는 버렸다는 생각이 들어. 며느리라는 아직 보지도 못하고 있지도 않는 존재에 대한 환상을 버린가는 가스라이팅도 아주 크렘-델-라-크렘.
오만가지 생각이 드네.
내가 며칠간 보낸 사진들을 읽씹하면서 무슨 생각을 했을까? 나는 전혀 이 상황이 나아질거라고 보지 않아. 최악의 시나리오를 또 그려야지.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;아버지는 나를 버리게 되겠지.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;지금부터라도 마음의 정리를 해야지. 말이 아니라 행동으로 보여준 아버지는 명확하게 나를 버린거야.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;엄마도 최근 이상해. 엄마가 생각하는 아들과 지금 나는 얼마나 다른 사람일까. 나는 엄마가 생각하는 이상적인 남성일지도 몰라. 지금까지 내가 봐온 엄마의 행동거지를 볼 때 그런것 같아. 하지만 나는 엄마의 감정 쓰레기통이기도 하지. 엄마는 아버지나 누나랑은 소통이 되지 않는다고 생각하거든. 했던 얘기 또 하는거를 나는 너무 잘 들어주고 공감해주기 때문에 내가 잘못 길들인 엄마의 버릇일수도 있겠다.
라고 생각해오고 있었는데, 아버지의 암수치가 올라감에 따라 받은 스트레스를 이용해 아버지의 삶을 조종하고픈 엄마의 모습에 공감하지 않자 엄마는 돌변했버렸어. 7월 초부터 거의 매일하던 전화통화는 한번도 하지 않았고, 간간히 보내는 문자도 문자라기 보다는 정말 간단한 안부; 내지는 카카오톡 앱에 있는 &quot;이모티콘&quot;만 보내는 정도. 나의 입장으로 볼 때 &quot;실패한 외교&quot;일까?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;재작년에 내가 교육학으로 전공을 바꾸었다고 말했을 때, 내가 자살얘기를 꺼내니까 보인 반응과는 너무 다른 모습이야.
나는 진짜 &quot;엄마&quot;라는 사람이 누구인지 모르겠어. 참 무서운 사람이야.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;hr &#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;부모 얘기는 그만 하자. 나는 내 자신에 대해 솔직한 삶을 살고 싶어. 그리고 그 대가를 치루고 있는거야.
나는 그러한 삶을 살기 위해서 치루어야 하는 대가라고 밖에 설명을 못하겠다.
설사 내 부모가 나를 버린다 하더라도 나는 나를 버리지 않을거야.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;재영아. 네 옆에는 너를 사랑하고, 우러러보고, 또 지지하는 사람들이 많아.
그런 사람들과 함께, 그렇게 살아가는 게 얼마나 고팠는지는 너도 잘 알잖아.
셰인을 만난 것만큼 큰 축복도 없을거야.
너는 이것들을 잊지 말아야해. 지켜나가야해.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;삶은 이런 식으로 슬퍼하기에는 너무 짧아. 너는 너의 삶을 살아가는거야. 그것만으로도 충분히 가치가 있어.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;기억해라. 너는 강해. 지금까지 살아온 너의 길을 잘 살펴봐.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;너는 실수하지 않아. 모든 돌을 밟아가며 앞길을 다져놓는 사람이 바로 너야.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;그리고 너는 사랑받을 자격이 있어.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;부모&quot;와 &quot;자식&quot;이라는 굴레에서 벗어나지못하면 너는 너무 많은것을 잃게돼.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;하지만 네 삶이잖아. 너는 너를 지켜야해. 항상 그랬듯이.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

          <title>On English spelling (Part 1)</title>
          <pubDate>Tue, 16 Jul 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

          <description xml:base="https://leothelion.wtf/on-spelling-1/">&lt;h2 id=&quot;let-us-d-o-r-i-m-e&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#let-us-d-o-r-i-m-e&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: let-us-d-o-r-i-m-e&quot;&gt;Let us &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=kLaaJ_aeoyM&quot;&gt;D O R I M E&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While mainland Europe boasts itself as a powerful union of nations, inventor of many ingenuities and the origin of democracy, it has never produced an alphabet of its own. Our own alphabet has its roots in pictographs. For example, the letter &lt;em&gt;A&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; comes from the Semitic aleph, meaning ‘ox’, and originally was a rough depiction of an ox’s head. &lt;em&gt;B&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; comes from the Semitic bēth, meaning ‘house’. Unlike those in the Far East, these Middle Easterners made a commitment so monumental that turned out to be most beneficial to us. They used their pictographs to depict sounds, rather than meaning such that–for example–the Egyptian hieroglyph for &lt;em&gt;re&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; did not also mean the Sun but for any syllable that sounded like &lt;em&gt;ray&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;they-have-it-worse&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#they-have-it-worse&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: they-have-it-worse&quot;&gt;They have it worse&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To truly appreciate the simple beauty of such a system, we should look at the headaches that manifest in Chinese languages. When rendering speech into writing, there are typically two ways: one is with an alphabet, like the one we have, and the other is with a pictographic-ideographic system like Chinese. In Chinese–regardless of simplification–the basic unit of writing is a character component called a &lt;em&gt;radical&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;. For example, radical for earth, ground and similar concepts is 土; water and related qualities is 水. All words in Chinese are formed from these two, as well as 212(!) other radicals. The Chinese are grateful though, because there used be staggering 540 radicals until an emperor named Kang Xi said enough is enough. Coming back to radicals, they are just building blocks. Radicals also compound with others to form new words. &lt;em&gt;grain&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; (禾) and &lt;em&gt;fire&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; (火) maketh &lt;em&gt;autumn&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; (秋); &lt;em&gt;arrow&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; (矢) and &lt;em&gt;bean&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; (豆) maketh &lt;em&gt;short&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; (短) and so on. Such words also compound with other words to form new meanings e.g., &lt;em&gt;bright&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; (明) and &lt;em&gt;dim&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; (暗) combine to mean &lt;em&gt;contrast&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;. Since every word requires its own symbol, Chinese script is immensely complicated. It possesses some 50,000 characters of which “only” about 4,000 are in common use. Writing in Chinese using the radical system is an enormous task and, before the age of smartphones and auto-completions, people could not type more than ten characters a minute. To be fair, if we had a key for every word in English, we would not be very fast typers either.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;or-not&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#or-not&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: or-not&quot;&gt;Or not&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, Chinese way of writing possesses one advantage over other ways–it can be read everywhere. Chinese is actually not a language at all, but more a family of loosely connected dialects. A Hokkien speaker can no more understand the speech of Shanghainese speaker than a Swede can understand a Spaniard. Dialects vary greatly by the region, especially in the south, where dialects can change every couple of kilometres. &lt;em&gt;Hold on, this does not sound like an advantage?&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; Hear me out. Even though speakers of Shanghainese, Cantonese, Hokkien and Dunggan may not understand each other very well when spoken, they can all share memes, read the same magazines, articles and newspapers because the written language is the same. The character might be read differently but they mean the same everywhere, similar to how characters 1, ? and 🍆 mean the same to us as it does to a French, though we see it as ‘one, question mark and some degree of promiscuity’ while they may as ‘une, point d’interrogation and &lt;em&gt;Oh là là&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;’.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;oh-god&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#oh-god&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: oh-god&quot;&gt;Oh god&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over here in &lt;em&gt;l’Occident&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, our way of writing begins to looks stupidly simple and ordered. It just makes sense. Yet, it is itself a pretty imperfect system for converting speech into thoughts. &lt;strong&gt;English is particularly hit and miss&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;. We have about 40 sounds in English, but only 26 letters–resulting in some 200(!) ways of spelling them. Take the ‘sh’ sound for example. It is one and the same sound denoted in linguistics as &#x2F;ʃ&#x2F;, but we can write it in 14 ways (&lt;em&gt;sh&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; in &lt;em&gt;shoe&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;s&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; in &lt;em&gt;sugar&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;ss&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; in &lt;em&gt;passion&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;t&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; in &lt;em&gt;ambitious&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;c&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; in &lt;em&gt;ocean&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;ch&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; in &lt;em&gt;champagne&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, etc.); the long ‘o’ &#x2F;oʊ&#x2F; (&#x2F;əʉ&#x2F; in Australian English) in about a dozen ways (&lt;em&gt;o&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; in &lt;em&gt;goat&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;eau&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; in &lt;em&gt;beau&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;ow&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; in &lt;em&gt;stow&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;ew&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; in &lt;em&gt;sew&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;oe&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; in &lt;em&gt;doe&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;ough&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; in &lt;em&gt;though&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; and so on), long ‘a’ &#x2F;ɛɪ&#x2F; (or &#x2F;æɪ&#x2F; in Aust. Eng.) in many many more (&lt;em&gt;ey&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; in &lt;em&gt;hey&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;ay&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; in &lt;em&gt;stay&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;a&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; in &lt;em&gt;make&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;eigh&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; in &lt;em&gt;freight&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;ai&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; in &lt;em&gt;maid&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;ea&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; in &lt;em&gt;great&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; etc.). the most remarkable example is ‘air’ &#x2F;ɛə&#x2F; which, with proper nouns included, has 38 variations of spelling for the same sound: &lt;em&gt;Aire&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Ayr&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;heir&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;e’er&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;ere&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; and so on.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, spellings in English are so messed up that even so-called figures of authority in English spelling fuck up, given every chance. To illustrate a few examples, in the printing of James Webster’s &lt;em&gt;New World Dictionary&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; had &lt;em&gt;millenium&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; in lieu of &lt;em&gt;millennium&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;. Robert Burchfield, an &lt;em&gt;Oxford Dictionary&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; editor of many years, wrote in &lt;em&gt;The English Language&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; while describing that grammar “prescriptivists regard innovation as dangerous or at any rate resistable …”–Ha, ha! It’s &lt;em&gt;resistible&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;. On personal account, a public health poster made by the Australian university I work at confidently used “practice good hygiene”–it should’ve been &lt;em&gt;practise&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think you’re the exception? Let’s take a quick test. Identify which of the following words are mispelled:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;supercede
&lt;br&gt;conceed
&lt;br&gt;procede
&lt;br&gt;idiosyncracy
&lt;br&gt;concensus
&lt;br&gt;accomodate
&lt;br&gt;tripthong
&lt;br&gt;rhythym
&lt;br&gt;opthalmologist
&lt;br&gt;diphteria
&lt;br&gt;caesarian
&lt;br&gt;grafitti
&lt;br&gt;anamolous
&lt;br&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To much surprise, they are &lt;em&gt;all&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; wrong. So was &lt;em&gt;mispelled&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; at the end of the preceeding paragraph. So was &lt;em&gt;preceeding&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; just then. You get the point–&lt;strong&gt;English is a really, really hard language to spell correctly.&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;in-defence-of-the-english-spelling&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#in-defence-of-the-english-spelling&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: in-defence-of-the-english-spelling&quot;&gt;In defence of the English spelling&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some say English does have some niceties that other European languages do not.
For example, we don’t litter our words with what’s called &lt;em&gt;diacritical marks&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;. These are marks that go above, below, around, through or inside letters to manipulate how they sound, think the umlauts in German as in &lt;em&gt;über&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;schön&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;. In languages where these marks do matter, they can be quite a pain too. In Hungarian, &lt;em&gt;tőke&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; means &lt;em&gt;stock&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, but &lt;em&gt;töke&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; gives you &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wiktionary.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;t%C3%B6ke&quot;&gt;balls&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. In Turkish &lt;em&gt;sıkıldım&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; means &lt;em&gt;‘I am bored’&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; while &lt;em&gt;sikildim&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; means &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;turkishlearning&#x2F;comments&#x2F;1c7quon&#x2F;comment&#x2F;l09mha3&quot;&gt;‘I have been fucked’&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. Messing up the diacritical mark can cost you very heavily.
And then there are observations about how spelling in English actually follow a kind of pattern (84% to be exact, according to David Crystal’s &lt;em&gt;The English Language&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;), such as in &lt;em&gt;latch&#x2F;hatch&#x2F;snatch&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;purse&#x2F;curse&#x2F;nurse&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;train&#x2F;pain&#x2F;rain&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, and that “only” about 3% of such are irregular.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those 3% of irregularities may seem negligible but they are absolutely maddening to a point where any argument in defence of English spelling can be thrown out the door. Why is &lt;em&gt;colonel&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; pronounced with an &lt;em&gt;r&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;? Why is 4 &lt;em&gt;four&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; in almost every instance–as in &lt;em&gt;fourteen&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;fourth&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;thirty-four&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;–until you get to &lt;em&gt;forty&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;? Where did the &lt;em&gt;u&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; go? Why does &lt;em&gt;ache&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; sound more like &lt;em&gt;hake&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; but not &lt;em&gt;arch&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;niche&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;; &lt;em&gt;bury&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; like a &lt;em&gt;berry&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; and not &lt;em&gt;fury&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;; &lt;em&gt;pretty&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; like &lt;em&gt;gritty&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; but not &lt;em&gt;petty&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;laziness&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#laziness&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: laziness&quot;&gt;Laziness&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All things happens for a reason, and sometimes it’s a matter of laziness and inattentiveness to yield some curious spellings. For example, &lt;em&gt;abdomen&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; has an &lt;em&gt;e&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; but it goes off somewhere with &lt;em&gt;abdominal&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;. Same for &lt;em&gt;hearken&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, where &lt;em&gt;e&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; just goes missing in &lt;em&gt;hark&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Colonel&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; is another classic example of such waywardness, and it’s for a historical reason as well (see &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wiktionary.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;colonel#English&quot;&gt;Wiktionary entry&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;). The word originates from Middle French &lt;em&gt;coronnel&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; which the French adapted from the Old Italian &lt;em&gt;colonnello&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;. When the word first came into English in 1548, it was spelled with an &lt;em&gt;r&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, but gradually, the Italian spelling and pronunciation began to challenge it. For centuries we’ve had both pronunciations and spellings until eventually settled on the most illogical result of French pronunciation with Italian spelling.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember how we talked about patterns in spelling? There are also complete anti-patterns, because, the old ways must be preserved regardless of how (il)logical it is. Take &lt;em&gt;ache&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;. The spelling of the word is not even &lt;strong&gt;trying&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; to be consistent in today’s standard of spelling. But here is the thing: &lt;em&gt;ache&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; was a noun, and was pronounced &lt;em&gt;aitch&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; prior to Shakespeare. It also had a verb counterpart which was pronounced &lt;em&gt;ake&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; and–quite sensibly–was spelled &lt;em&gt;ake&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;. This &lt;em&gt;ch&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&#x2F;&lt;em&gt;k&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; conjugate pairing was and is quite prevalent e.g., &lt;em&gt;speech&#x2F;speak&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;stitch&#x2F;stick&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;stench&#x2F;stink&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;. Despite all these sensibilities, &lt;em&gt;ache&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; decided to defy logic and adopted the &lt;em&gt;verb&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; pronunciation while retaining the noun spelling.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;universal-decree-not&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#universal-decree-not&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: universal-decree-not&quot;&gt;Universal decree (not)&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How about &lt;em&gt;forty&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;? Mixed accounts of both &lt;em&gt;fourty&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;forty&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; exist. Chaucer certainly used it with a &lt;em&gt;u&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; in the 14th century e.g., “… And I was fourty, if I shal seye sooth;” in &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;poets.org&#x2F;poem&#x2F;canterbury-tales-wife-baths-prologue-excerpt&quot;&gt;Canterbury Tales&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, as did others throughout the 16th century. Then, it quietly &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;books.google.com&#x2F;ngrams&#x2F;graph?content=fourty%2Cforty&amp;amp;year_start=1500&amp;amp;year_end=2019&amp;amp;corpus=en-GB-2019&amp;amp;smoothing=0&amp;amp;case_insensitive=true&quot;&gt;vanishes&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; as &lt;em&gt;forty&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; takes over. It’s most unusual for a word to change its spelling while the pronunciation has not–unless, of course–there was some universal decree.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I regularly help people out with their &lt;span class=&quot;latex&quot;&gt;L&lt;sup&gt;A&lt;&#x2F;sup&gt;T&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;&#x2F;sub&gt;X&lt;&#x2F;span&gt; grievances, and one occasion I was met with this question:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
I’m trying to use LXfonts in Lua&lt;span class=&quot;tex&quot;&gt;T&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;&#x2F;sub&gt;X&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;, but it’s so outdated that it only has Type 1 fonts, and even among those I don’t know where to find the font containing the regular characters. The documentation doesn’t help either since it’s outdated too. Is there a direct or easier way of using its package on Lua&lt;span class=&quot;tex&quot;&gt;T&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;&#x2F;sub&gt;X&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;?
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m an avid user of &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ctan.org&#x2F;pkg&#x2F;fontspec&quot;&gt;fontspec&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and have written a &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ponte-vecchio&#x2F;otf2fontspec&quot;&gt;CLI tool&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; to ease its use of and incorporating the knowledge of OpenType fonts, but I’ve never tried to load Type 1 fonts through fontspec.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How &lt;em&gt;do you&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; manipulate Type 1 fonts with fontspec in Lua&lt;span class=&quot;tex&quot;&gt;T&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;&#x2F;sub&gt;X&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;? This will be the topic of this post.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;on-type-1-fonts&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#on-type-1-fonts&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: on-type-1-fonts&quot;&gt;On Type 1 fonts&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all, there’s a lot going on when it comes to fonts and &lt;span class=&quot;tex&quot;&gt;T&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;&#x2F;sub&gt;X&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;. For the taskmasters of &lt;span class=&quot;latex&quot;&gt;L&lt;sup&gt;A&lt;&#x2F;sup&gt;T&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;&#x2F;sub&gt;X&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;, nitty-gritty details of the fonts we load are not of significant concern. Often are font selections limited to a few popular choices----pxfonts, stix, or the plain old Computer Modern. Perhaps we take for granted the fonts we load, and the unseen iceberg of complexity in older fonts like &lt;code&gt;lxfonts&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;. This is particularly true for when we are using pdf&lt;span class=&quot;tex&quot;&gt;T&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;&#x2F;sub&gt;X&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;----where the fonts we load are in some obscure format many of us have no idea about, such as &lt;code&gt;.pfa&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;.pfb&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;.tfm&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;. When we venture into the &lt;code&gt;fonts&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; directory of our &lt;span class=&quot;tex&quot;&gt;T&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;&#x2F;sub&gt;X&lt;&#x2F;span&gt; distribution, we are met with a peculiar list, particularly for the incognoscenti:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;sh&quot; style=&quot;background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;&quot; class=&quot;language-sh &quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-sh&quot; data-lang=&quot;sh&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#bf616a;&quot;&gt;$&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; ls
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#bf616a;&quot;&gt;afm&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; cid cmap enc lig map misc ofm opentype ovf ovp pk sfd source tfm truetype type1 type3 vf
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside from the obvious &lt;code&gt;truetype&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;opentype&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;, what do the other ones mean? This 2014 post from &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tex.stackexchange.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;205229&quot;&gt;TeX.SE&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; gave me a good overview of what some of these might be:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;Name&lt;&#x2F;th&gt;&lt;th style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;Description&lt;&#x2F;th&gt;&lt;&#x2F;tr&gt;&lt;&#x2F;thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;afm&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;td&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;Adobe Font Metrics, a text file that contains information about the metrics of a font.&lt;&#x2F;td&gt;&lt;&#x2F;tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;cid&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;td&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;a format for describing fonts that contains glyphs for CJK characters, provided by fontforge (see e.g., &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;fontforge&#x2F;fontforge&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;contrib&#x2F;cidmap&#x2F;src&#x2F;README&quot;&gt;here&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;)&lt;&#x2F;td&gt;&lt;&#x2F;tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;cmap&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;td&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;seems to contain &lt;b&gt;c&lt;&#x2F;b&gt;haracter &lt;b&gt;map&lt;&#x2F;b&gt;pings, particularly for CJK fonts.&lt;&#x2F;td&gt;&lt;&#x2F;tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;enc&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;td&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;contains encoding files, which map character code to glyph indices.&lt;&#x2F;td&gt;&lt;&#x2F;tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;lig&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;td&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;contains ligature files---supposedly for use with &lt;code&gt;fontspec&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;td&gt;&lt;&#x2F;tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;map&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;td&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;helps &lt;span class=&quot;tex&quot;&gt;T&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;&#x2F;sub&gt;X&lt;&#x2F;span&gt; figure out which font file corresponds to which font, and whether the font encoding has been altered in any way.&lt;&#x2F;td&gt;&lt;&#x2F;tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;ofm&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&#x2F;&lt;code&gt;tfm&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;td&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;contain &lt;span class=&quot;tex&quot;&gt;T&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;&#x2F;sub&gt;X&lt;&#x2F;span&gt; font metrics files, which are often generated from &lt;code&gt;afm&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;pfm&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; files. In the context of &lt;span class=&quot;tex&quot;&gt;T&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;&#x2F;sub&gt;X&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;, these are proper fonts but do not contain actual glyphs (see &lt;code&gt;type1&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;)&lt;&#x2F;td&gt;&lt;&#x2F;tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;pk&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;td&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;pre-prepared fonts based on METAFONT sources&lt;&#x2F;td&gt;&lt;&#x2F;tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;sfd&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;td&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;stands for &lt;b&gt;s&lt;&#x2F;b&gt;pline &lt;b&gt;f&lt;&#x2F;b&gt;ont &lt;b&gt;d&lt;&#x2F;b&gt;atabase, which is a font format used by FontForge. As far as &lt;span class=&quot;tex&quot;&gt;T&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;&#x2F;sub&gt;X&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;Live 2024 is concerned, it seems to contain subfont database for mapping CJK fonts for something.&lt;&#x2F;td&gt;&lt;&#x2F;tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;source&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;td&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;contains METAFONT source files for generating pre-prepared fonts&lt;&#x2F;td&gt;&lt;&#x2F;tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;type1&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;td&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;contains only the &lt;em&gt;pictures&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; of the characters, so these are fairly useless without some metric information. These therefore go hand-in-hand with &lt;code&gt;ofm&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;tfm&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; files.&lt;&#x2F;td&gt;&lt;&#x2F;tr&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;tbody&gt;&lt;&#x2F;table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This suggests that any &lt;strong&gt;PostScript (PS) Type 1 font actually comprises multiple files&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;, contrary to OpenType (&lt;code&gt;.otf&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;.otc&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;) and TrueType (&lt;code&gt;.ttf&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;.ttc&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;) fonts which are &lt;em&gt;single files&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; (see &lt;cite&gt;Phinney, 1997&lt;&#x2F;cite&gt;).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ctan.org&#x2F;pkg&#x2F;lxfonts&quot;&gt;LXFonts&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; is a package that provides a set of fonts for use with &lt;span class=&quot;tex&quot;&gt;T&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;&#x2F;sub&gt;X&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;. It is a collection of Sli&lt;span class=&quot;tex&quot;&gt;T&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;&#x2F;sub&gt;X&lt;&#x2F;span&gt; fonts that are based on the Computer Modern fonts with restyled maths fonts, specifically the &lt;em&gt;letters&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; (maths italics, upper and lower Greek); &lt;em&gt;symbols&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; for uppercase calligraphic letters; and the &lt;em&gt;delimiters&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; for large delimiters and operators. The package is just over 10 years old, is largely unmaintained.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Typically, in conjunction with fontspec, the way to load a font is to simply use the font name, or the file name of a font. If we wanted to load a package-less font, such as &lt;code&gt;Baskervaldx&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;, we can look for its files as follows:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;bash&quot; style=&quot;background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;&quot; class=&quot;language-bash &quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#65737e;&quot;&gt;# $TEXMFDIR&#x2F;fonts
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#bf616a;&quot;&gt;fd -e&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; otf&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#bf616a;&quot;&gt; -e&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; ttf baskervaldx
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#bf616a;&quot;&gt;opentype&#x2F;public&#x2F;baskervaldx&#x2F;Baskervaldx-Bol.otf
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#bf616a;&quot;&gt;opentype&#x2F;public&#x2F;baskervaldx&#x2F;Baskervaldx-BolIta.otf
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#bf616a;&quot;&gt;opentype&#x2F;public&#x2F;baskervaldx&#x2F;Baskervaldx-Ita.otf
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#bf616a;&quot;&gt;opentype&#x2F;public&#x2F;baskervaldx&#x2F;Baskervaldx-Reg.otf
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is straight forward, it’s a single directory, with a single or a couple OTF files. When we look for a directory named lxfonts, this is not so evident:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;bash&quot; style=&quot;background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;&quot; class=&quot;language-bash &quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#65737e;&quot;&gt;# $TEXMFDIR&#x2F;fonts
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#bf616a;&quot;&gt;$&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; fd&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#bf616a;&quot;&gt; -t&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; dir lxfonts
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#bf616a;&quot;&gt;map&#x2F;dvips&#x2F;lxfonts&#x2F;
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#bf616a;&quot;&gt;source&#x2F;public&#x2F;lxfonts&#x2F;
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#bf616a;&quot;&gt;tfm&#x2F;public&#x2F;lxfonts&#x2F;
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#bf616a;&quot;&gt;type1&#x2F;public&#x2F;lxfonts&#x2F;
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, the &lt;code&gt;tfm&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; directory contains the following files:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;bash&quot; style=&quot;background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;&quot; class=&quot;language-bash &quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#65737e;&quot;&gt;# $TEXMFDIR&#x2F;fonts&#x2F;tfm&#x2F;public&#x2F;lxfonts
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#bf616a;&quot;&gt;$&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; tree

&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#bf616a;&quot;&gt;1&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; directory, 21 files
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While not shown here, there’s a combination of files to provide lxfonts. Specifically we find &lt;code&gt;.mf&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;.pfb&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;.tfm&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;.map&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;. As a zoomer, I have no idea what these are, and what they do. What we do know is that &lt;code&gt;.tfm&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; files contain designations to glyphs, but not the glyphs themselves. Perhaps we can use these &lt;code&gt;.tfm&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; files to load the fonts in fontspec?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;loading-tfm-works&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#loading-tfm-works&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: loading-tfm-works&quot;&gt;Loading .tfm works!&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is what I found—Loading the &lt;code&gt;.tfm&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; works! The manner in which we load fonts in fontspec does not accommodate the loading of Type 1 fonts—indeed—but trial and error suggests that designating fontspec to load the &lt;code&gt;tfm&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; files by specifying the extension, followed by the font name, works. The following example is a successful example at precisely that:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;!-- loading TFMs work --&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;latex&quot; style=&quot;background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;&quot; class=&quot;language-latex &quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-latex&quot; data-lang=&quot;latex&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#96b5b4;&quot;&gt;\setmainfont&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;{lecl}[
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;    Extension = .tfm,
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;    UprightFont = *q8,
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;    ItalicFont = *i8,
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;    BoldFont = *b8,
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;    BoldItalicFont = *o8
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;]
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;lecl-takes-the-cake&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#lecl-takes-the-cake&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: lecl-takes-the-cake&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;lecl&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; takes the cake&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With further testing, I found that &lt;code&gt;lecl&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; is the font we should designate as the text font. While &lt;code&gt;llcmss&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; is the suggested one in the &lt;code&gt;lxfonts&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; documentation, &lt;code&gt;lecl&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;EC&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;T1&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; encoded thus contains twice as many glyphs (256) than the &lt;code&gt;OT1&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; encoded &lt;code&gt;llcmss&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; (128). We don’t want to introduce more headaches by having to deal with legacy encoding issues, so it makes most sense to select &lt;code&gt;lecl&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-about-others-lcmmi&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#what-about-others-lcmmi&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: what-about-others-lcmmi&quot;&gt;What about others? &lt;code&gt;lcmmi&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On that note, it is possible to mix-and-match, such as using &lt;code&gt;lcmmi&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;. According to the source file, &lt;code&gt;lxfonts&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; provides &lt;code&gt;lcmmi&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; which are &quot;math-as-text&quot; fonts. We can thus consider replacing &lt;code&gt;*i8&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; with &lt;code&gt;lcmmi8&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-about-the-rest&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#what-about-the-rest&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: what-about-the-rest&quot;&gt;What about the rest?&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upon cross-examining with the source &lt;code&gt;.dtx&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; file with the list of fonts available, others listed relate to mathematical symbols—we will not worry about that with fontspec.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post concerns the loading of old Type 1 fonts with a modern font loader: fontspec in &lt;span class=&quot;latex&quot;&gt;L&lt;sup&gt;A&lt;&#x2F;sup&gt;T&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;&#x2F;sub&gt;X&lt;&#x2F;span&gt; using &lt;code&gt;lxfonts&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; as an example. I talked briefly on legacy and modern font file formats, and how they are structured, and how they are loaded in &lt;span class=&quot;latex&quot;&gt;L&lt;sup&gt;A&lt;&#x2F;sup&gt;T&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;&#x2F;sub&gt;X&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;.
I found that the &lt;code&gt;.tfm&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; files of the Type 1 font can be loaded, such as &lt;code&gt;lecl&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; in the case of &lt;code&gt;lxfonts&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

<p>While mainland Europe boasts itself as a powerful union of nations, inventor of many ingenuities and the origin of democracy, it has never produced an alphabet of its own. Our own alphabet has its roots in pictographs. For example, the letter <em>A</em> comes from the Semitic aleph, meaning ‘ox’, and originally was a rough depiction of an ox’s head. <em>B</em> comes from the Semitic bēth, meaning ‘house’. Unlike those in the Far East, these Middle Easterners made a commitment so monumental that turned out to be most beneficial to us. They used their pictographs to depict sounds, rather than meaning such that–for example–the Egyptian hieroglyph for <em>re</em> did not also mean the Sun but for any syllable that sounded like <em>ray</em>.</p>
<h2 id="they-have-it-worse"><a class="zola-anchor" href="#they-have-it-worse" aria-label="Anchor link for: they-have-it-worse">They have it worse</a></h2>
<p>To truly appreciate the simple beauty of such a system, we should look at the headaches that manifest in Chinese languages. When rendering speech into writing, there are typically two ways: one is with an alphabet, like the one we have, and the other is with a pictographic-ideographic system like Chinese. In Chinese–regardless of simplification–the basic unit of writing is a character component called a <em>radical</em>. For example, radical for earth, ground and similar concepts is 土; water and related qualities is 水. All words in Chinese are formed from these two, as well as 212(!) other radicals. The Chinese are grateful though, because there used be staggering 540 radicals until an emperor named Kang Xi said enough is enough. Coming back to radicals, they are just building blocks. Radicals also compound with others to form new words. <em>grain</em> (禾) and <em>fire</em> (火) maketh <em>autumn</em> (秋); <em>arrow</em> (矢) and <em>bean</em> (豆) maketh <em>short</em> (短) and so on. Such words also compound with other words to form new meanings e.g., <em>bright</em> (明) and <em>dim</em> (暗) combine to mean <em>contrast</em>. Since every word requires its own symbol, Chinese script is immensely complicated. It possesses some 50,000 characters of which “only” about 4,000 are in common use. Writing in Chinese using the radical system is an enormous task and, before the age of smartphones and auto-completions, people could not type more than ten characters a minute. To be fair, if we had a key for every word in English, we would not be very fast typers either.</p>
<h2 id="or-not"><a class="zola-anchor" href="#or-not" aria-label="Anchor link for: or-not">Or not</a></h2>
<p>However, Chinese way of writing possesses one advantage over other ways–it can be read everywhere. Chinese is actually not a language at all, but more a family of loosely connected dialects. A Hokkien speaker can no more understand the speech of Shanghainese speaker than a Swede can understand a Spaniard. Dialects vary greatly by the region, especially in the south, where dialects can change every couple of kilometres. <em>Hold on, this does not sound like an advantage?</em> Hear me out. Even though speakers of Shanghainese, Cantonese, Hokkien and Dunggan may not understand each other very well when spoken, they can all share memes, read the same magazines, articles and newspapers because the written language is the same. The character might be read differently but they mean the same everywhere, similar to how characters 1, ? and 🍆 mean the same to us as it does to a French, though we see it as ‘one, question mark and some degree of promiscuity’ while they may as ‘une, point d’interrogation and <em>Oh là là</em>’.</p>
<h2 id="oh-god"><a class="zola-anchor" href="#oh-god" aria-label="Anchor link for: oh-god">Oh god</a></h2>
<p>Over here in <em>l’Occident</em>, our way of writing begins to looks stupidly simple and ordered. It just makes sense. Yet, it is itself a pretty imperfect system for converting speech into thoughts. <strong>English is particularly hit and miss</strong>. We have about 40 sounds in English, but only 26 letters–resulting in some 200(!) ways of spelling them. Take the ‘sh’ sound for example. It is one and the same sound denoted in linguistics as /ʃ/, but we can write it in 14 ways (<em>sh</em> in <em>shoe</em>, <em>s</em> in <em>sugar</em>, <em>ss</em> in <em>passion</em>, <em>t</em> in <em>ambitious</em>, <em>c</em> in <em>ocean</em>, <em>ch</em> in <em>champagne</em>, etc.); the long ‘o’ /oʊ/ (/əʉ/ in Australian English) in about a dozen ways (<em>o</em> in <em>goat</em>, <em>eau</em> in <em>beau</em>, <em>ow</em> in <em>stow</em>, <em>ew</em> in <em>sew</em>, <em>oe</em> in <em>doe</em>, <em>ough</em> in <em>though</em> and so on), long ‘a’ /ɛɪ/ (or /æɪ/ in Aust. Eng.) in many many more (<em>ey</em> in <em>hey</em>, <em>ay</em> in <em>stay</em>, <em>a</em> in <em>make</em>, <em>eigh</em> in <em>freight</em>, <em>ai</em> in <em>maid</em>, <em>ea</em> in <em>great</em> etc.). the most remarkable example is ‘air’ /ɛə/ which, with proper nouns included, has 38 variations of spelling for the same sound: <em>Aire</em>, <em>Ayr</em>, <em>heir</em>, <em>e’er</em>, <em>ere</em> and so on.</p>
<p>In fact, spellings in English are so messed up that even so-called figures of authority in English spelling fuck up, given every chance. To illustrate a few examples, in the printing of James Webster’s <em>New World Dictionary</em> had <em>millenium</em> in lieu of <em>millennium</em>. Robert Burchfield, an <em>Oxford Dictionary</em> editor of many years, wrote in <em>The English Language</em> while describing that grammar “prescriptivists regard innovation as dangerous or at any rate resistable …”–Ha, ha! It’s <em>resistible</em>. On personal account, a public health poster made by the Australian university I work at confidently used “practice good hygiene”–it should’ve been <em>practise</em>.</p>
<p>Think you’re the exception? Let’s take a quick test. Identify which of the following words are mispelled:</p>
<center>
<p>supercede
<br>conceed
<br>procede
<br>idiosyncracy
<br>concensus
<br>accomodate
<br>tripthong
<br>rhythym
<br>opthalmologist
<br>diphteria
<br>caesarian
<br>grafitti
<br>anamolous
<br></p>
</center>
<p>To much surprise, they are <em>all</em> wrong. So was <em>mispelled</em> at the end of the preceeding paragraph. So was <em>preceeding</em> just then. You get the point–<strong>English is a really, really hard language to spell correctly.</strong></p>
<h2 id="in-defence-of-the-english-spelling"><a class="zola-anchor" href="#in-defence-of-the-english-spelling" aria-label="Anchor link for: in-defence-of-the-english-spelling">In defence of the English spelling</a></h2>
<p>Some say English does have some niceties that other European languages do not.
For example, we don’t litter our words with what’s called <em>diacritical marks</em>. These are marks that go above, below, around, through or inside letters to manipulate how they sound, think the umlauts in German as in <em>über</em> and <em>schön</em>. In languages where these marks do matter, they can be quite a pain too. In Hungarian, <em>tőke</em> means <em>stock</em>, but <em>töke</em> gives you <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/t%C3%B6ke">balls</a>. In Turkish <em>sıkıldım</em> means <em>‘I am bored’</em> while <em>sikildim</em> means <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/turkishlearning/comments/1c7quon/comment/l09mha3">‘I have been fucked’</a>. Messing up the diacritical mark can cost you very heavily.
And then there are observations about how spelling in English actually follow a kind of pattern (84% to be exact, according to David Crystal’s <em>The English Language</em>), such as in <em>latch/hatch/snatch</em>, <em>purse/curse/nurse</em>, <em>train/pain/rain</em>, and that “only” about 3% of such are irregular.</p>
<p>Those 3% of irregularities may seem negligible but they are absolutely maddening to a point where any argument in defence of English spelling can be thrown out the door. Why is <em>colonel</em> pronounced with an <em>r</em>? Why is 4 <em>four</em> in almost every instance–as in <em>fourteen</em>, <em>fourth</em>, <em>thirty-four</em>–until you get to <em>forty</em>? Where did the <em>u</em> go? Why does <em>ache</em> sound more like <em>hake</em> but not <em>arch</em> or <em>niche</em>; <em>bury</em> like a <em>berry</em> and not <em>fury</em>; <em>pretty</em> like <em>gritty</em> but not <em>petty</em>?</p>
<h3 id="laziness"><a class="zola-anchor" href="#laziness" aria-label="Anchor link for: laziness">Laziness</a></h3>
<p>All things happens for a reason, and sometimes it’s a matter of laziness and inattentiveness to yield some curious spellings. For example, <em>abdomen</em> has an <em>e</em> but it goes off somewhere with <em>abdominal</em>. Same for <em>hearken</em>, where <em>e</em> just goes missing in <em>hark</em>. <em>Colonel</em> is another classic example of such waywardness, and it’s for a historical reason as well (see <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/colonel#English">Wiktionary entry</a>). The word originates from Middle French <em>coronnel</em> which the French adapted from the Old Italian <em>colonnello</em>. When the word first came into English in 1548, it was spelled with an <em>r</em>, but gradually, the Italian spelling and pronunciation began to challenge it. For centuries we’ve had both pronunciations and spellings until eventually settled on the most illogical result of French pronunciation with Italian spelling.</p>
<p>Remember how we talked about patterns in spelling? There are also complete anti-patterns, because, the old ways must be preserved regardless of how (il)logical it is. Take <em>ache</em>. The spelling of the word is not even <strong>trying</strong> to be consistent in today’s standard of spelling. But here is the thing: <em>ache</em> was a noun, and was pronounced <em>aitch</em> prior to Shakespeare. It also had a verb counterpart which was pronounced <em>ake</em> and–quite sensibly–was spelled <em>ake</em>. This <em>ch</em>/<em>k</em> conjugate pairing was and is quite prevalent e.g., <em>speech/speak</em>, <em>stitch/stick</em> and <em>stench/stink</em>. Despite all these sensibilities, <em>ache</em> decided to defy logic and adopted the <em>verb</em> pronunciation while retaining the noun spelling.</p>
<h3 id="universal-decree-not"><a class="zola-anchor" href="#universal-decree-not" aria-label="Anchor link for: universal-decree-not">Universal decree (not)</a></h3>
<p>How about <em>forty</em>? Mixed accounts of both <em>fourty</em> and <em>forty</em> exist. Chaucer certainly used it with a <em>u</em> in the 14th century e.g., “… And I was fourty, if I shal seye sooth;” in <a href="https://poets.org/poem/canterbury-tales-wife-baths-prologue-excerpt">Canterbury Tales</a>, as did others throughout the 16th century. Then, it quietly <a href="https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=fourty%2Cforty&amp;year_start=1500&amp;year_end=2019&amp;corpus=en-GB-2019&amp;smoothing=0&amp;case_insensitive=true">vanishes</a> as <em>forty</em> takes over. It’s most unusual for a word to change its spelling while the pronunciation has not–unless, of course–there was some universal decree.</p>
